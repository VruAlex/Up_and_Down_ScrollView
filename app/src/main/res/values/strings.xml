    <string name="one">Android added a new Myanmar font to Android Q that is Unicode-compliant and capable
        of rendering both Unicode and non-Unicode Burmese (commonly known as Zawgyi), right out of the box.
        This means starting in Android Q, Android makes it easier for users to switch to Unicode: a user can
        now use a Unicode font to read Unicode and non-Unicode text for the first time. Android also added new
        requirements to the Android ecosystem CDD that takes a stronger stance in requiring Unicode, including a
        new subtag "Qaag" which OEMs should use as a locale designating non-Unicode Burmese. All of these changes
        should make developersâ€™ life easier in the long term, as reduced ecosystem fragmentation makes it easier to
        develop for our 50M users in Myanmar.</string>
